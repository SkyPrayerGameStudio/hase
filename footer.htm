	<p>Hase is released under the GPLv2+. The sourcecode is available at
	<a href="http://github.com/theZiz/hase">Github</a>. For compilation it needs
	SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer and SDL_net. Furthermore it needs my own library
	<a href="http://github.com/theZiz/sparrow3d">Sparrow3D</a>, which is based
	on SDL.</p>

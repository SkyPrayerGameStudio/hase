Complaint #1: Unability to see where you are aiming at large zoom-outs: http://wstaw.org/m/2014/08/21/screenshot124.png
Complaint #2: Unability to tell which of your characters you are currently controlling (sure, it's the one the camera is centered at, but you can still get lost) http://wstaw.org/m/2014/08/21/screenshot125.png
Complaint #3: The particle effects should not be visible at large zooms, they spam the screen: http://wstaw.org/m/2014/08/21/screenshot126.png
Complaint #4: I dislike the new zoom control (in steps), I liked when it was stopping to zoom when I released the key

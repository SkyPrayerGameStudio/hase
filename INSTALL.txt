Maybe try first, whether hase builds on your system with
make
Especially "sparrow3d" (http://www.github.com/theZiz/sparrow3d) is needed
If everything is fine and you can run hase with
./hase
you can install it with
(sudo) ./install.sh <bin directory> <share directory>
e.g.:
sudo ./install.sh /usr/local/bin /usr/local/share
This will build hase again, but with these fixed folders, and install it
You can uninstall hase with
(sudo) ./uninstall.sh <bin directory> <share directory>
and the same parameters as used for ./install.sh, e.g.
sudo ./uninstall.sh /usr/local/bin /usr/local/share
Alternatively you can delete the hase binary and in the binary folder
and the hase folder in the share folder.

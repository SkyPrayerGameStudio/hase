<description lang="en_US">
The provocative and risqu√© game that has jaded a generation of upstanding citizens. It has been said to make lewd references to _drug-use_ and _antisocial_ behaviours. 	  				 	 	 	    		  	   		  		
Players are reported to believe they are hares. Reporting a new sense of gravity previously unheard of.  	  				 	 	 	    		  	   		  		
Jump around, jump up, jump up, and jump down.
Wage war against productivity and the established society. Energetic beats!
Squinting is highly recommended to fully experience the graphics.
